Create an application that implements the rules of the Fizz-Buzz game.

A user gives a number (or many) and expects a reply with numbers divisible by three replaced with the word "fizz" and numbers divisible by five with the word "buzz".

See more detailed description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

* The application has to be written in a language runnable on JVM.
* The game must be playable through an HTTP API
* Make the code repository available to us. E.g. from GitHub or BitBucket
* Even though the assignment is rather simple, produce production-level code
* You should complete the task by the team interview. But please, give some time for reviewers to check it before the interview.
* Feel free to ask additional questions via email: georgiy.lidskiy@solveva.com
